<h3><font face="Copperplate Gothic" color="white">What is COVID-19?</font></h3>
<p>Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, is a contagious respiratory illness with several severe symptoms. It is an airborne disease that spreads within people who are not sufficently spread apart through respiratory droplets from sneezing or coughing. This is why facemasks are our saviors, so please don't forget to wear them! People might think that if they are completely vaccinated, the do not have to wear masks anymore, but that is incorrect! When you are fully vaccinated, that only means you have resistance against the virus when you are in contact with it. However, you will have the virus on or inside yourself when you come in contact with it, but still not get affected due to your immunity to the virus. Since the virus can also be passed on by physical contact, people around you who aren't vaccinated will most likely get affected. The virus thrives indoors since it has no other place to go except to come to you! Other ways to stay safe and healthy include washing hands with soap regularly, using hand sanitizer when handwashing is unavailable at the moment, maintaining 6 feet social distancing, avoiding large indoor gatherings, and wearing your facemask. The next time someone wants to shake your hand, you know what to do- namaste!
